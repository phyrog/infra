## About the project

infra is a closed bittorrent tracker for smaller communities and companies, to enable your users to share their content in a private Peer2Peer way.

### Status

infra is not even in alpha stadium yet, so it currently is in no condition to be used in any way.

### Goals

* Full bittorrent tracker functionality
* Easily searchable torrent database
* Mandatory user invitation
* Remove other trackers from torrent files, so only registered peers can download the files
* Personalize announce url for each user to make sure only authorized users can download files
* Custom torrent properties for tagged torrents (e.g. Torrents tagged as Images can have a resolution)
